=========================

This module was written to extend the manufacturing capabilities of Odoo,
and adds automatic re-scheduling capabilities to the manufacturing order
and the associated work orders. It also shows a gantt chart view that
adjusts automatically during the execution of the manufacturing order and
work orders.
