This module allows to configure a product that has a BoM of type kit to disallow partial
deliveries so that the components can't be partially delivered.

Configuration
=============

To allow/disallow the partial delivery of kits:

#. Go to the kit product template or variant and then to the *Inventory* tab,
   *Logistics* group.
#. The "Allow Partial Kit" check controls this. If marked, it will allow it.
#. By default, the check is not marked.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Make a delivery picking with a kit product.
#. Try to deliver it partially.
#. An error will raise.

If you want to deliver other items in the picking you can do so and leave the
whole kit components units pending in a backorder.
