This module is activated on a warehouse by checking the "Primecontractor Raw
Material" checkbox on the warehouse form view.

To set up a prime contractor, start by adding a new location with the prime 
contractor view as parent and with the prime contractor partner as "Primecontractor".

Next check the "Primecontractor Raw Material" checkbox on the Bill Of Material lines
corresponding to the raw materials coming from the prime contractor.

Finally set up the Prime Contractor Location on the Reordering Rules of these
raw materials products. The associated procurement group will be set automatically.
