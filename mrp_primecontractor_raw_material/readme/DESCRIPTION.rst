This module helps managing as a subcontractor raw materials comming from the 
prime contractor. It adds on the warehouse a new location view (../PRM/) that
will contain the raw material locations (one per prime contractor).

Manufactued products from a Bill Of Material with configurated prime contractor 
raw materials will take these raw materials from the subcontractor location.

These locations can be resupplied from a configurated orderpoint and will generate
a receipt picking with a specific type (../PRM/) and the prime contractor as partner.
