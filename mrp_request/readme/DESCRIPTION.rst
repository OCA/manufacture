This module extends the functionality of Manufacturing to allow you to use
Manufacturing Request (MR) as a previous step to Manufacturing Orders (MO).

Some of the benefits you can obtain are:

* Allow managers to review what is going to be manufactured.
* Better control of manufacturing calendar.
* Manage big requirements splitting them in batches.
* Know your bottleneck component in advance and only schedule what you really
  can build.
