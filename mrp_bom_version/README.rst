Installation
============

There is no specific installation procedure for this module.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to Manufacturing / Configuration

Usage
=====

The following states are defined:

* **Draft**:
  The form will be available for data entry, and may move to "active" state.
* **Active**:
  You can modify all of the form fields except for the fields: routing, BoM
  lines, and the new field Active, for false default when you create a new BoM.
  The "active" state may be passed back to state "draft", if we mark the new
  field "Allow re-edit the BoM list", this new field is defined in
  *Configuration > Configuration > Manufacturing*. You can configure there also
  if those BoM will continue with active check marked as True or not.
  The active state may move to state "Historical".
* **Historical**:
  This is the last state of the LdM, you can not change any field on the form.

When the MRP BoM list is put to active, a record of who has activated, and when
will include in chatter/log. It also adds a constraint for the sequence field
to be unique.

* **New version** :
  By clicking the button version, current BOM is moved to historical state,
  and a new BOM is creating based on this but with version number +1 and
  changing state to draft
