* This module has only been tested for simple normal BoM (with only one level and no workorders), it may work with other configurations up to you to test it !
* This module only works with components (or BoM lines products) which are not tracked (neither by lot nor by SN)
* This module makes the traceability smart buttons show all components used for producing all SN as source (meaning that if for a serialized final product, you need 1 A and 1 B component, if you generate 10 serialized final products, in traceability for each it will show 10 A and 10 B components)
