The goal of this module is to make a partner ready for subcontracting flow and simplify their subcontracting management by adapting mrp_subcontracting_partner_management to mrp_subcontracting_purchase features.

This module is auto-installing and replaces the following records created by mrp_subcontracting_management:

- A Stock Operation Type of type 'receipt' for this location
- A new 'Buy' stock rule
- A new 'Resupply Subcontractor on Order' rule

With the following records: 

- A new 'Buy' stock rule for "Dropship Subcontractor on Order" route
- A new 'Pull from' stock rule for "Dropship Subcontractor on Order" route
