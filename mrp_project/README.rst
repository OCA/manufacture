================
MRP Project Link
================

This module links projects and tasks to *manufacturing orders* (MO) and
*work orders* (WO).

Installation
============

It depends on the module *mrp_analytic*, that is hosted on
OCA/account-analytic: https://github.com/OCA/account-analytic

Usage
=====

TODO: Update.

In a manufacturing order (MO), you can select a project to be attached to it.
If none is selected, a project is automatically created. When the MO starts, a task is created and assigned to the order.

For creating a new Project:
1. Go to your MO.
2. Do click in `Choose Project`: you can choose one or to leave it blank in order to create a new project.
3. Do click in `Choose Project`.

You could see the new project in the project list or see the MO in your chosen Project.

For creating a new Task:
1. Go to your MO, it must not have any workorder in process.
2. Do click  in `Create Workorders`, it will create a new task inside of Manufacturing's project.
3. Go to your Project an view the new `To Do` task.

After the creation of work orders, you will find the corresponding tasks in the project linked to the manufacturing order in the `To Do` stage.

For Analytics Account review:
1. Activate `Analytic Accounts` management: check `Invoicing > Settings > Analytics > Analytic Accounting`.
2. Go to `Invoicing > Configuration > Analytic Accounts`.
3. Go to your `Analytic Account`.
