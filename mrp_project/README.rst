2. Do click in `Choose Project`: you can choose one or to leave it blank in order to create a new project.
3. Do click in `Choose Project`.

You could see the new project in the project list or see the MO in your chosen Project.

For creating a new Task:
1. Go to your MO, it must not have any workorder in process.
2. Do click  in `Create Workorders`, it will create a new task inside of Manufacturing's project.
3. Go to your Project an view the new `To Do` task.

After the creation of work orders, you will find the corresponding tasks in the project linked to the manufacturing order in the `To Do` stage.
