This module allows to duplicate a product with variants, at the same time creating a BoM with type "Kit" for the new product mapping variants of the original product.

This is useful when managing products that only exist as a "front" for a product with another name, to avoid having to manually map variants in BOM.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The use case is that customer sells the same product with two different names, prices, etc - but on the stock side, **Product 1 (copy)** only exists as a kit of **Product 1** (they're physically the same product)

Usage
=====

* In user, enable "Can duplicate with kit" access right
* Open "Product 1" with variants
* Use server action: "Duplicate with attribute match kit"
* A wizard opens up with field "New product template name"
* Inputs name for duplicated product (eg: "Fancy Product 1")
* Click Confirm

A new product is created with name "Fancy Product 1" and a new BOM of type "kit" for this product;

  If product does not have variants, when using server action, display error message: "This server action can be used only on products with variants".
