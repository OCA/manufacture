Create a Product of type "Service" for each cost type needed.
Set their usage hourly cost on the Product form.

It is recommended to organize these "cost type" products in appropriate Product Categories.

On the Product Category, "Operations Costing" section, configure the accounts to use:

* Consumption Account: the account to credit.
* Work in Progress Account: the account to debit the work in progress amounts.
* Variance Account: the account to debit the variance versus the expected.

On each Work Center, select the Cost Type products to use.
This will drive the hourly cost and the accounts for use to post WIP/Variances.
