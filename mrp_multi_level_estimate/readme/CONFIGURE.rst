You can edit how to consolidate your estimates as demand at product MRP area
level using the field *Group Days of Estimates*. This number represents the
days to group your estimates as demand for the MRP, e.g: if set to 7, you will
have your estimates (regardless of the date range used) grouped in weekly
demand.
