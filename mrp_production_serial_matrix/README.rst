This module aims to ease the processing of Manufacturing Orders with the
following characteristics:

* The finished product is tracked by unique serial numbers.
* The quantity to be produced is more than one unit.
* Some of the components are tracked by serial numbers and/or lots.

Usage
=====

Go to a Manufacturing Order with the characteristics described above, then
proceed as follows:

#. Click on the button "Serial Numbers Matrix".
#. Fill the *Finished Product Serials Numbers*. As you fill them you will see
   how the matrix below is updated.
#. Fill the matrix. The matrix is composed of one row per final serial number
   and one column per component serial number or lot needed to complete the
   production.
#. Click on *Validate*. You will be redirected to all the MOs generated.

Take into account the following:

* You need to attend all the warnings at the bottom before validating the
  matrix. They help you to identify error in the input (duplicated serial
  numbers, not enough stock...).
* Rows with no final lot are ignored. You will have a backorder MO for the
  remaining quantity.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Currently, there are some limitations :

* Components tracked by lots will only have one column. This means that all the
  quantity needed of this component to manufacture a finished product unit (
  serial number) will be consuming a single lot.
