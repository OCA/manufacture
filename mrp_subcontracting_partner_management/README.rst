The goal of this module is to simplify the management of the partner properties used in MRP Subcontracting.

It adds a new checkbox "Subcontractor" which when enabled creates the following entities:

* A child location in the "Subcontracting" location
* A Stock Operation Type of type 'receipt' for this location
* A new 'Buy' stock rule
* A new 'Resupply Subcontractor on Order' rule

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To see newly created rules, go to **Settings** > **Inventory** and activate "Multi step routes".

It is also possible to allow a user to check inventory locations in **Sales & Purchases** tab of **Vendor** without activating dev mode.
To do so, enable technical extra right **Display Inventory section on Vendor** in user.

Usage
=====

* Select a partner of type "Company"
* Enable the "Subcontractor" checkbox
* New entities are created or existing are used if were created previously
* When disabled all associated enties will be archived
* When name of subcontractor is updated, names of entities are updated automatically.
* It is also possible to check inventory locations using **Subcontractor Location Stock** smart button on partner.
* When name of subcontractor is updated, names of entities (subcontracting location, operation type, rules) are updated automatically.
