Configure a QC trigger in the product, product template, or product category to define the conditions for creating inspections:

* Trigger: Choose the trigger to activate the inspection process.
* Test: Define a group of questions with valid values for the inspection.
* Responsible: Assign a user responsible for the QC inspection.
* Partner: Optionally specify partners to limit the test to actions involving them.
* Timing: Determine when inspections are generated:
    * Before: On picking confirmation.
    * After: On picking completion.
    * Plan Ahead: On picking confirmation, generating a non-editable plan inspection that becomes executable post-picking completion.
