======================
MRP Production Request
======================

This module extends the functionality of Manufacturing to allow you to use
Manufacturing Request (MR) as a previous step to Manufacturing Orders (MO).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module to automatically generate Manufacturing Requests
from procurement orders instead of directly create manufacturing orders yo
need to:

#. Go to the products that you want them to trigger manufacturing orders.
#. Go to the *Inventory* tab.
#. Check the route *manufacture* and the box *Manufacturing Request*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Manufacturing > Manufacturing Requests*.
#. Create a manufacturing request or open a existing one (assigned to you or
   created from a procurement).
#. If you click on *Request approval* button the user assigned as approver
   will added to the thread.
#. If you are the approver you can either click on *Approve* or *Reject*
   buttons.
#. Rejecting a MR will cancel associated procurements and propagate this
   cancellation.
#. Approving a MR will allow to create manufacturing orders.
#. You can manually set to done a request by clicking in the button *Done*.

To create MOs from MRs you have to:

#. Go to approved manufacturing request.
#. Click on the button *Create Manufacturing Order*.
#. In the opened wizard, click on *Compute lines* so you will have a
   quantity proposed for creating a MO. This quantity is the maximum quantity
   you can produce with the current stock available in the source location.
#. Use the proposed quantity or change it and click on *Create MO* at the
   bottom of the wizard.

**NOTE:** This module does not restrict the quantity that can be converted
from a MR to MOs. It is in hands of the user to decide when a MR is ended and
to set it to *Done* state.
