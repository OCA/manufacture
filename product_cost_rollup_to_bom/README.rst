With Standard Cost Method, products that have bill of materials defined show rollup cost from the BOM. This module allows the cost to be rolled up based on BOM's that have components change standard price. The module can be used from product template/product variant forms using "Compute BOM Cost Rollup" or from the Scheduled Job across all BOM's that need an update. The module sends an email on modified standard cost products to an email configured on the Manufacturing App.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
