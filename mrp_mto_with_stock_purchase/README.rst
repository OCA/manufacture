This module make compatible mrp_mto_with_stock and purchase modules.
Indeed, there is an option in mto_mto_with_stock to check the forecast stock
when checking the availibility of a Manufacture Order. But this forecast stock
does not take into account the quantities coming from draft POs. This module
adds this behavior.

Configuration
=============

* This module is installed automatically when mrp_mto_with_stock and purchase module are installed

Usage
=====

When a manufacturing order is created out of a procurement evaluation
(from an orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the computation
of the planned start date of the manufacturing order.

For example, if it takes 1 day to manufacture a product and it is required
for Monday, the manufacturing order will be created with planned start date
on the previous Friday, if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working
calendar.
