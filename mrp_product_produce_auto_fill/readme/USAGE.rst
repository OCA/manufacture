This module adds an **Auto Fill** button on the *Produce* wizard: if
all the lots/serials for the raw materials listed in the *Produce*
wizard are the ones that are used for this manufacturing order, just
click on the **Auto Fill** button: you won't have to manually enter the
quantities in the *Done* column manually.
