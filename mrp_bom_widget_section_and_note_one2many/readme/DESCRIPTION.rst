In a similar way to invoices, this module adds the possibility to add sections
ands notes in Bills of Materials.
It adds a page in BoM form view and hide the orignal page (you can see it
as admin in debug mode)

Depends on account module since widget 'section_and_note' is defined on
section_and_note_fields_backend.js in account module.
