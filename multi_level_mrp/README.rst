Multi Level MRP
===============

This module allows you to calculate, based in known inventory, demand, and
supply, and based on parameters set at product variant level, the new
procurements for each product.

To do this, the calculation starts at top level of the bill of material
and explodes this down to the lowest level.

Key Features
------------
* MRP parameters at product variant level
* Basic forecast system
* Cron job to calculate the MRP demand
* Manually calculate the MRP demand
* Confirm the calculated MRP demand and create BID's, PO's, or MO's
* View to see the products for which action is needed
