This module adds a new BOM type Supplier which can be identified easily with the new search filter.
This BOM type will functionally have the same behavior as a BOM of type Manufacture for a product which does not have a Route "Manufacture": the product is not manufactured and the components are not purchased.
This can be used to keep track of the Components used by a Supplier to manufacture a product you purchase.
