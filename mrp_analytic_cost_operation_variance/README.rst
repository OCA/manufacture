In Job-like scenarios, an initial estimate is prepared and used to quote the customer.
When the order is confirmed, manufacturing can start.
This feature allows to keep a record of the initial operations estimates, that can be later used to analyze variances between the actual vs expected costs.

Usage
=====

Ensure the Work Centers have configured their Analytic Cost structures.

When the MO is confirmed, the initial estimated costs and quantities are captured, for each Analytic Cost configured in the work centers used.

* The estimated time for each Operation line is captured.
* The Analytic Cost quantities and unit costs are captured for all the Analytic Costs for each Operation / Work Center.

After the MO is confirmed, when executing the operations, the actuals per Analytic Cost are collected and stored as Analytic Items. This information allows to compute the variances between the estimated and the expected costs and quantities.

The Manufacturing Cost Analysis can be seen at Manufacturing > Reporting > Cost Analysis.

This provides data on estimated, actual and variances for the quantities and cost amounts, detailed by MO, Work Center, Product/Cost Type, and Cost Type Category.
