This module was written to extend the functionality of Bill of
Materials to support users to better maintain the BOM hierarchy.

This module replaces the existing BOM tree views with a new one, from
which the user can create a complete BOM hierarchy.

The user can navigate from the  tree view to child BOM's, or to the
product's BOM components with a single click.

The user can now search using the field 'Complete Reference' (or Name) to
find all the BOM hierarchy associated to a particular BOM Reference (or
Name) at once.
