            <p>This module allows to subcontract Manufacturing Orders

When a manufacturing order is subcontracted, a Subcontractor is selected (from Suppliers) and optionnally a service to be subcontracted for the manufacturing (e.g. Painting or Assembly).
Raw materials from BOM and finished materials pickings and stock moves are automatically created, as well as purchase order in case a service to be subcontracted has been selected.</p>
