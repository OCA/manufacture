When this module is installed, you get an additional parameter on the mrp.area records:

* Safety stock lead date

Until that date, the MRP Multi Level planner
will consume the safety stock without attempting to rebuild it, and only
resupply if the forecasted stock goes below zero. 

If the date is in the paste, nothing special happens.
