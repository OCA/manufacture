This module extends the repair management functionality in Odoo, providing additional
options for handling the repair process in a more customizable and efficient way.
It allows the configuration of repair steps based on specific business requirements
and adds new picking types for managing component addition and removal in repair orders.

The main features are:

- Customize repair steps: Choose between a 1-step, 2-step, or 3-step repair process.
- Add and remove components during the repair process using separate picking types.
- Associate repair orders with pickings for improved traceability.
- Automatic creation of pickings and procurement routes based on the selected repair steps.
- Manage repair locations and routes more efficiently with warehouse settings.
