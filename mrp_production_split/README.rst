This module adds a "Split" button to Manufacturing Orders.

Manufacturing Orders can be split as long as they haven't been completed yet.

For products tracked by "Serial Number", it allows to choose the Quantity to extract
from the original MO, and it'll create one MO per single unit.

For other products, more options are available, that will let you do things like:

* Extract 10 units from a MO into 5 MOs of 2 units each.
* Extract 10 units from a MO into a single new MOs.
* Extract 10 units from a MO into multiple MOs of different quantities.

This module is a backport from OCA/Manufacture v15.0
It also backport some Odoo SA Code
