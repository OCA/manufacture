Manufacturing costs are only generated when a Manufacturing Order is closed.

This feature allows to track costs while the manufacturing is in progress.
This is done for raw materials used, by generating Analytic Items when the stock is reserved.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
