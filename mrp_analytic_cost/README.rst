Out of the box, manufacturing costs are only generated
when a Manufacturing Order is closed.

There are cases where the manufacturing costs need to be tracked in real time.
This is especially important for manufacturing scenarios with a long cycle time,
spanning for multiple months.

This feature allows to track costs while the manufacturing is in progress,
both for raw materials used and work order operations.

Costs incurred are stored as Analytic Items, and can then be analyzed.
No journal entries are generated.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To use:

* On the Manufacturing Order, set the Analytic Account to use. This may correspond to a Project.
* On Manufacturing Orders, Analytic Items are automatically generated when:

  * Raw materials are consumed, or
  * Time is spent on work order Operations, with a Work Center with a Cost Type product set.

To analyze costs:

* Go to Manufacturing > Reports > Analytic Items. The cost data is available there and can be used for analysis.
* At Project > Dashboard, "Project Overview" form, a summary of the costs for the corresponding Analytic Account is presented.
