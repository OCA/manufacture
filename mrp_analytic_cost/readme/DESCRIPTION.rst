Out of the box, manufacturing costs are only generated
when a Manufacturing Order is closed.

There are cases where the manufacturing costs need to be tracked in real time.
This is especially important for manufacturing scenarios with a long cycle time,
spanning for multiple months.

This feature allows to track costs while the manufacturing is in progress,
both for raw materials used and work order operations.

Costs incurred are stored as Analytic Items, and can then be analyzed.
No journal entries are generated.
