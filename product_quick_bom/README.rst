This module was written to be able to quickly create the BoM for your product. There is a new "Bill of Materials" tab in the product form view that allows the user to add a BoM and its lines directly.

Beware that this functionality is relevant only when one product template has one Bill of Materials, and works only for product templates for simplicity's sake.

Usage
=====

Go to product form view, click on edit, use the BoM lines field. If there is no BoM for the product yet, you can quickly create one by clicking on the "Create BoM" button.
