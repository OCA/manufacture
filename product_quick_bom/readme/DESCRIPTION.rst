This module was written to be able to quickly create the BoM for your product. There is a new "Bill of Materials" tab in the product form view that allows the user to add a BoM and its lines directly.

Beware that this functionality is relevant only when one product template has one Bill of Materials, and works only for product templates for simplicity's sake.
