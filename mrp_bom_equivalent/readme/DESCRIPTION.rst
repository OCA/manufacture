This module allows the user to specify non-equivalent products to a part on a BOM.

When creating a manufacturing order, if there is no availability of the product defined
in the Bill of Materials and Use equivalents have been checked, the product (belonging to
the same equivalent category) with more priority that is available, will be proposed instead.
