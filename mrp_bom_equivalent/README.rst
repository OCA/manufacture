=====================
MRP BoM Equivalences
=====================

This module allows the user to specify non-equivalent products to a part on a BOM.

Other modules can assume that products in the same category are equivalent and can be used in a Manufacturing Order if the main part is not available. Those non-equivalent products can be excluded.

Usage
=====

* Go to Manufacturing > Master Data > Bill of Materials
* Create or update a BOM to check the box "Use Equivalences"
* Set the non-equivalent products among the products of the same category
