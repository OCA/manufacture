This module adds support on mrp manufacturing orders for the MTS+MTO rule from
stock_mts_mto_rule module (from https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-warehouse)

You can then configure a pick before manufacture route which will only pick if
there is no stock left in the source location of the manufacturing order.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To use the MTS + MTO rules for manufacturing on a warehouse:

1. configure the warehouse to use "Pick components and then manufacture (2 steps)"
2. Find the route "Pick components and then manufacture" of the
   warehouse. There should be 2 rules: one to pull products from Stock and
   bring it to PreProduction (using MTS), and one to pull products from
   PreProduction and to bring it to Production (MTO). You need to create 2 new
   rules:

   * one route to pull products from PreProduction and bring it to Production (MTS), using the Manufacturing operation type
   * one route to choose between MTS and MTO, with Operation Type:
     Manufacturing, Source location PreProduction, Destination Production, MTS
     rule: the one created in the previous step, MTO rule: the preexisting MTO
     rule pulling from PreProduction to Production

Usage
=====

Once the routes are configured, there is nothing special to do.
