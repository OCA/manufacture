This bridge module adds some smart buttons between Purchase and
Subcontracting

**DISCLAIMER:** This module is a backport from Odoo SA and as such, it
is not included in the OCA CLA.

That means we do not have a copy of the copyright on it like all other
OCA modules.

This is a backporting of features from mrp_subcontracting modules from
v15 allowing to setup a flow addressing the following use case:

Vendor 1 manufactures and sells “Finished Product”

Vendor 2 manufactures and sells “Component Product” (used to manufacture
“Finished Product”)

Vendor 3 sells “Element Product” (used to manufacture “Component
Product”)

As an example, in the case where there is no available qty for each of
these three products, creating a PO purchasing “Finished product” for
Vendor 1 generates:

-  The standard receipt picking from Vendor 1 to our warehouse
-  A PO for Vendor 2 for product “Component Product”
-  A subcontracting order for Vendor 1 for “Finished Product”, with
   component location: Vendor 1 subcontracting location

Once this PO is confirmed, this generates:

-  A dropship picking for Vendor 1 from Vendor 2 for “Component Product”
-  A subcontracting order for Vendor 2 for “Component Product”, with
   component location: Vendor 2 subcontracting location
-  A PO for Vendor 3 for product “Element Product”

Once this PO is confirmed, this generates:

-  A dropship picking for Vendor 2 from Vendor 3 for “Element Product”
