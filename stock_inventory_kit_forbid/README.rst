By default kits cannot be used in pickings, so it make no sense to create inventory
adjustments for them.

Configuration
=============

In order to disable the constraint:

#. Go to the kit product template or variant and then to the *Inventory* tab,
   *Logistics* group.
#. The "Allow Inventory Adjustments" check controls this. If marked, it will allow it.
#. By default, the check is not marked.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Try to create an inventory adjustment for a product that is a kit in the company
#. Check a constraint is raised when creating the inventory adjustment

If you want to force the inventory adjustment, there is a checkbox in the product
template for that
