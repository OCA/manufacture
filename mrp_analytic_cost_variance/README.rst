In Job-like scenarios, an initial estimate is prepared and used to quote the customer.
When the order is confirmed, manufacturing can start.
This feature allows to keep a record of the initial material estimates, that can be then used to analyze variances between the actual vs expected costs.

Usage
=====

Once an MO is confirmed, the initial estimated costs are captured, for quantities and cost amount. These are stored and kept unchanged throughout the lifetime of the MO.

While executing the manufacturing process, actual costs and quantities are recorded stored through Analytic Items. This information allows to compute the variances between the estimated and the expected costs and quantities.

The Manufacturing Cost Analysis can be seen at Manufacturing > Reporting > Cost Analysis.
This provides data on estimated, actual and variances for the quantities and cost amounts, detailed by Analytic Account, MO, Product/Cost Type, and Cost Type Category.
