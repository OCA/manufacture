Auto-validate manufacturing orders when the "Pick components" transfer operation
is validated. This feature has to be enabled for each Bill of Material to produce.

Configuration
=============

Warehouse
~~~~~~~~~

* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Settings* to enable the *Multi-Step Routes* option
* Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses* and enable the manufacturing
  with two or three steps on your warehouse (to get a *Pick components* transfer
  operation generated when you create a MO).

Bill of Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Go to *Manufacturing > Products > Bills of Materials* and enable the auto-validation
  of manufacturing orders for your BoMs (*Order Auto Validation* field).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add support of auto-validation as soon as we have enough components to produce
  at least one finished product. Currently Odoo doesn't support this
  (`reservation_state` of MO is still set to "Waiting" in such case).
