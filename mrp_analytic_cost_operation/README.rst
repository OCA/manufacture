This feature allows to track operations costs while the manufacturing is in progress.
We want to be able to track those costs in near real time. This is especially important to manufacturing orders with a long cycle time, spanning for multiple months.

These manufacturing operations can incur in several cost types.
For example, labor, perishable tooling, overhead, etc.
Cost records are generated for all the different cost types, as Analytic Items.

Usage
=====

To use:

* On the Manufacturing Order, set the Analytic Account to use. This may correspond to a Project.
* At Manufacturing > Work Orders, track time spent on operations, as usual. These records will automatically generate cost records as Analytic Items.

To analyze costs:

* Go to Manufacturing > Reports > Analytic Items. The cost data is available there and can be used for analysis.
* At Project > Dashboard, "Project Overview" form, a summary of the costs for the corresponding Analytic Account is presented.
