This module allows to apply putaway strategies to the products resulting from
the manufacturing orders.

The finished products will be placed in the location designated by the putaway
strategy (if they do not have another destination move), based on the
finished products location that was defined in the manufacturing order.

Configuration
=============

To configure a putaway strategy follow the next steps:

#. Go to 'Inventory / Settings'. Activate the option 'Multi-Step Routes' and
   save.
#. Go again to 'Inventory / Settings' and press
   'Set Putaway Strategies on Locations'. Then define a putaway strategy in
   the location zone where the finished products are supposed to be placed,
   and indicate the specific sub-location/bin where the products should
   be placed.

Usage
=====

To use this module proceed as follows:

#. Create a manufacturing order and indicate the product and the finished
   products location zone.
#. Confirm the manufacturing order.
#. You will notice that the finished products location has changed to the
   putaway location, and the chatter shows a message indicating that the
   putaway strategy was applied.
