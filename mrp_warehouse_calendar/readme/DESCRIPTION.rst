With this module the manufacturing orders created from procurements consider
the calendar assigned to the warehouse of the picking type of the
manufacturing order to determine, based on the product's manufacturing
lead time, the planned start date of the manufacturing order.

Further manual replannings of start/end date of the manufacturing order
also consider the lead time using the warehouse calendar days.
