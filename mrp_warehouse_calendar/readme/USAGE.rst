When a manufacturing order is created out of a procurement evaluation
(from an orderpoint, MTO,...) the calendar is considered in the computation
of the planned start date of the manufacturing order.

For example, if it takes 1 day to manufacture a product and it is required
for Monday, the manufacturing order will be created with planned start date
on the previous Friday, if the warehouse operates under a Mo-Fri working
calendar.
