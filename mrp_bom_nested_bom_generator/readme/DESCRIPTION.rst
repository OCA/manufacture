This module simplifies creation of BOMs for the 'nested' products.
Such as when a final product is manufactured a result of
the series of simple intermediate operations.

Example: we manufacture a 'table' from 'wood'.
Following operations will be involved (in reverse order):

* Assemble the table from the parts
* Paint table parts (legs, desk etc)
* Manufacture parts from a raw wood

Using this module you can easily create BOMs for all this operations from a single tab.
